        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
        It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
        React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
        However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM,
        and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries
        for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries.

    Components:

<div class="descrip.">
    <p>
    React code is made of entities called components. Components can be
    rendered to a particular element in the DOM using the React DOM library. 
    When rendering a component, one can pass in values that are known as "props".
    The two primary ways of declaring components in React is via functional 
    components and class-based components.

<h5>
    Functional Components:
</h5>
<div class="descrip.">
    <p>
    Functional components are declared with a function that then returns some JSX.
</p>
</div>
<h6>
    Class-Based Components:
</h6>
<div class="descrip.">
    <p>
    Class-based components are declared using ES6 classes.
    They are also known as "stateful" components, because their state can hold
    values throughout the component and can be passed to child components through props.
